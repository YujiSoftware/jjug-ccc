{"id":"e6dd5b96-d31f-4338-a219-af5bef4e8ca5","title":"Bulletproof Java Enterprise Applications for The Hard Production Life","description":"It’s one thing to develop Java Enterprise applications, to execute, and validate them in test environments. Running the application in production, however, is a whole other story. Production life is harsh, unforgivable and the ultimate verification whether your application is able to add value to its users. Besides knowing the Java Enterprise APIs, developers therefore also need to know how to meet production requirements.\r\n\r\nThis session shows which non-functional requirements we enterprise developers need to be aware of to build stable and resilient applications. We will see different resiliency approaches, such as circuit breakers, bulkheads, or backpressure, in action. We will implement these concepts using the Java Enterprise API, MicroProfile, and certain Java EE extensions. Furthermore, we will see, how especially service meshes enable us to add resiliency to multiple microservices in a transparent, redundancy-free fashion.","target":"Enterprise developers","speakers":[{"name":"Sebastian Daschner","companyOrCommunity":"IBM","bio":"Sebastian Daschner is a Java Developer Advocate at IBM, a consultant, author, and trainer.
