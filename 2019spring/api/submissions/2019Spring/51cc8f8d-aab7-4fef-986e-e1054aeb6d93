{"id":"51cc8f8d-aab7-4fef-986e-e1054aeb6d93","title":"Serverless Java: Challenges and Triumphs","description":"Serverless Functions are hot and developer and corporate interest is exploding! But although Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world it isn’t the most popular language for writing functions—at least not yet. According to James Governor, “[When Web Companies Grow Up They Turn into Java shops](https://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2016/10/12/when-web-companies-grow-up-they-turn-into-java-shops/)” so as functions become mainstream will Java become the dominant language for authoring functions? Can it be? In this session we’ll examine the challenges to using Java for functions and the latest features provided by the Java platform that address them, including the use of [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/aot-compilation/)'s native image generation. We’ll also dig into the open source [Fn Project](http://fnproject.io)’s unparalleled Java support which makes it possible to build, test, and scale out Java-based functions applications.\r\n","target":"Java Developers","speakers":[{"name":"Shaun Smith","companyOrCommunity":"Oracle Canada","bio":"Shaun Smith leads product management of Serverless technologies at Oracle and is a member of the open source Fn Project functions platform team.
