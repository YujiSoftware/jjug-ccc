Now we are in Functional Programming era. At least this is what they said.\r\nBut what does it mean design in Functional way? How can category theory, which is a Mathematical tool-set help us here?\r\nIn OOP we the 4 Rules of Simple Design and TDD. Is it possible to still use them in Functional Programming? \r\nI think so and I'll show some concrete examples from my day to day job of how these four rules work very well with the theoretical concepts of functional programming. Categories, functors and natural transformations can naturally emerge from our code and understand them can lead to a better design.\r\n","target":"Java programmers","speakers":[{"name":"Uberto Barbini","companyOrCommunity":"London Java Community","bio":"Uberto is a polyglot programmer and independent consultant, with more than 20 years experience designing and building successful software products, currently working with finance institutions in London.\r\nHe is a very passionate and opinionated programmer, he enjoys public speaking and blogging.\r\nUberto's main interests are Jvm languages, Functional Programming and distributed computing. \r\nCurrently writing a book about Kotlin.\r\nHe firmly believe in Agile Manifesto values and principles and he is practicing TDD since 2000.\r\n質問は日本語でも大丈夫です","activityList":[{"activityType":"TWITTER","url":"https://twitter.com/ramtop"},{"activityType":"GITHUB","url":"https://github.com/uberto"},{"activityType":"OTHER","url":"https://medium.com/@ramtop"}],"github":"uberto","profileUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/uberto?size=120"}],"category":"その他","level":"中級者向け","talkType":"一般枠 (45分)","language":"英語","createdAt":"2019-02-11T13:12:07Z","updatedAt":"2019-03-16T18:15:39Z","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://jjug-cfp.cfapps.io/v1/conferences/eab1136d-27dc-4874-81bc-7511ba540c69/submissions/dcbd5783-fb04-462e-aa4a-df4cbe2af838"}}}
