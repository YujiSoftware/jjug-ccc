All the demos in this session will be using QuarkusIO, showing how Java has become awesome and not an alien anymore in severless world . #JavaIsEverAwesome #JavaNoAlienToServerless","target":"Audience with knowledge of fundamentals of Kubernetes","speakers":[{"name":"Kamesh Sampath","companyOrCommunity":"Red Hat","bio":"Kamesh is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, as part of his additional role as Director of Developer Experience at Red Hat -- he actively educates on Kubernetes/OpenShift, Servicemesh, and Serverless technologies --.
