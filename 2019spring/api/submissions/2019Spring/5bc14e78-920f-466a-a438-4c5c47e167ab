{"id":"5bc14e78-920f-466a-a438-4c5c47e167ab","title":"Stateless Microservice Security via JWT and MicroProfile","description":"The learning curve for REST API security is severe and unforgiving. Specifications promise infinite flexibility, habitually give old concepts new names, and almost seem designed to deliberately confuse. With an aggressive distaste for fancy terminology, the first half of this session delves into OAuth 2.0 with and without JWTs and shows how it falls into two camps: stateful and stateless. Starting at Basic Auth and walking forward, we'll compare each with heavy focus on the wire, showing actual HTTP messages and analyzing their impact on load and security against a baseline Microservice architecture.\r\n\r\nThe second half of this presentation we'll deep dive into MicroProfile JWT, which offers a clean Java API and standard configuration for consuming JWTs in Java Microservices. Code and demo focused, we'll see a complete MicroProfile JWT, TomEE and AngularJS app that issues JWTs with custom backend-data, performs server-side verification and injection of claims, and client-side login and refresh. All code in Github, you'll leave ready to bootstrap your next truly secure full-stack project.","target":"REST API Developers","speakers":[{"name":"David Blevins","companyOrCommunity":"Tomitrib","bio":"Founder of Tomitribe, veteran of Open Source Java EE in both implementing and defining JavaEE specifications for over 15 years with a strong drive to see JavaEE simple, testable and as light as Java SE.
