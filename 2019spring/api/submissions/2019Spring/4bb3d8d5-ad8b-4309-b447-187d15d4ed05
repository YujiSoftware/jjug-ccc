This session shows how to use Spark SQL as an interactive big data exploration tool; discusses how to use your Java code in advanced transformations, in the cloud, and in a Docker environment; and presents tips for solving common performance issues. Through live demos, it also shows real-world examples and how the speakers’ team managed to process billions of records to generate useful insights.","target":"Java developers that want to explore the big data universe","speakers":[{"name":"Fernando Babadopulos","companyOrCommunity":"Tail - Target Audience and Insights Lab","bio":"Fernando Babadopulos is a Java Champion, software architect, entrepreneur, and enthusiast of new technologies; he was responsible for developing some of the most popular web applications in Brazil and abroad.
