The session will share the experiences and knowledge acquired during the development:\r\n-How develop micro-services with Microprofile and JEE\r\n-How continuously deploy the micro-services to the cloud (Azure).\r\n-How monitor and debug micro-services with ELK stack.\r\n\r\nDuring the development of the platform there were many successes and failures that the team learned from. The experiences will be shared with the audience. Also the trade-offs of using a complex architecture like micro-services compare to a monolith application.\r\n\r\nThe summary will highlight the lessons and pitfalls learned.","target":"Developers","speakers":[{"name":"skalster","companyOrCommunity":"HiQ Stockholm","bio":"Victor Duran grow up in Spain and move to Sweden where he came in contact with Java in 2002. \r\nHe has more than ten years of experience with Java development and has also used other languages like Erlang or Clojure.\r\n\r\nHe has presented at JavaOne and JCrete; he volunteers in JFokus and JForum (Meetup) in Stockholm. \r\nAdditionally he runs the competence group for HiQ bringing international speakers, organizing workshops and sharing knowledge with colleagues.
