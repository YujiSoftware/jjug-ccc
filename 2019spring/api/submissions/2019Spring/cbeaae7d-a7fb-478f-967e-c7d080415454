Without it, there is no way to tell whether the service is even working. And what about this new buzzword observability? It’s a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. If the system can’t adequately externalize their state, then even the best monitoring can fall short. Also, we should not forget the human factor. No matter how cutting edge our tools are supposed to be, they’ll count for little if people don’t or can’t use them when designing, developing, testing and operating applications.\r\n\r\nAs complexity increases in distributed systems, we need to bake instrumentation in from day one. What tools are there and how to utilise them for each stakeholder through the DevOps assembly line and beyond?","target":"Developers, Operations, SRE's, Product and Engineering Managers whose responsibility it is to ensure customer satisfaction","speakers":[{"name":"Erno Venäläinen","companyOrCommunity":"Oracle","bio":"Erno started his career as a full stack web developer at a time when the only option to do web development was full stack.\r\nAfter a decade or so of developing (mostly Java) added value software on top of enterprise applications he drifted more and more to life cycle management, performance tuning and cloud operations.\r\nAt some point, he learned it could be called DevOps.\r\nCurrently, he specialises in helping Oracle customers adopt Cloud Native technologies and more Agile development practices.\r\nHis hobbies include painting Warhammer 40k miniatures (while waiting for his kids to be old enough to play), radio controlled cars & FPV drones and developing telemetry systems for racing motorcycles.","activityList":[{"activityType":"TWITTER","url":"https://twitter.com/venalainene"},{"activityType":"GITHUB","url":"https://github.com/evenalainen"}],"github":"evenalainen","profileUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/evenalainen?size=120"}],"category":"Dev Ops","level":"中級者向け","talkType":"一般枠 (45分)","language":"英語","createdAt":"2019-02-20T13:05:18Z","updatedAt":"2019-03-21T13:47:25Z","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://jjug-cfp.cfapps.io/v1/conferences/eab1136d-27dc-4874-81bc-7511ba540c69/submissions/cbeaae7d-a7fb-478f-967e-c7d080415454"}}}
